- `git clean`: Clean the repository. Removes untracked files and directories from the working directory.
- `git clone`: Clone a repository. Creates a copy of a remote repository on the local machine.
- `git commit`: Commit changes to the repository. Records changes to the repository with a commit message.
- `git describe`: Describe the repository. Provides a human-readable name for the latest commit based on tags.
- `git diff`: View differences. Shows changes between commits, branches, or working directory and staging area.
- `git fetch`: Fetch changes. Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them.

- `git commit-tree`: Commit tree. Creates a new commit object with the given tree and parent.
- `git count-objects`: Count objects. Displays the number of unpacked objects and their disk consumption.
- `git daemon`: Start the repository daemon (server). Allows Git repositories to be accessed via the git:// protocol.
- `git diff`: View differences. Shows changes between commits, branches, or working directory and staging area.
- `git diff-files`: Show differences in files. Compares files in the working directory with the index.
- `git diff-index`: Show differences in the index. Compares the index with a given commit.
- `git diff-tree`: Show differences in the tree. Compares the content and mode of blobs found via two tree objects.
- `git fetch`: Fetch changes. Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them.
- `git for-each-ref`: Iterate over references. Applies a command to each reference.
- `git fsck`: Check the file system. Verifies the connectivity and validity of the objects in the database.
- `git gc`: Garbage collect the repository. Cleans up unnecessary files and optimizes the local repository.
